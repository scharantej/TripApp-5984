## Flask Application Design for Travel Scheduling

### HTML Files

1. **index.html**: This file serves as the landing page of the application. It presents a list of transportation options (e.g., train, bus, flight, donkey, ferry, bike) and allows users to select and combine modes of transport for their journey.
2. **results.html**: This file displays the results of the journey search. It lists the available travel options along with their respective schedules and prices.

### Routes

1. **index**: This route handles the logic behind the index page, allowing users to select and combine transportation options.
2. **results**: This route processes the user's input from the index page and fetches the available travel options from the selected modes of transport. It then displays the results in the results.html file.

### Implementation

1. Create a virtual environment and install Flask and Bootstrap using pip.
2. Structure your project directory with the necessary folders and files, as specified in the HTML Files and Routes sections.
3. In the 'index.html' file, use Bootstrap to create a visually appealing interface for selecting transportation options.
4. In the 'results.html' file, design a clear and informative layout to display the travel options and their details.
5. In the 'index' route, implement the logic to capture user input and redirect to the 'results' route.
6. In the 'results' route, use Python code to query the necessary transportation APIs to fetch the available travel options.
7. Pass the retrieved data to the 'results.html' file to display the results to the user.
8. Test the application thoroughly to ensure its functionality and user-friendliness.
